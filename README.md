# 3D Mobile Speed Simulator

## Overview

My 3D mobile game is developed in Unity with C#. It is a third-person speed simulator with physics inspired by one of my favourite childhood games "Sonic and the Secret Rings". The project is an *unfinished* 3d open world speed simulator. The project includes dynamic player acceleration based on player level, jump and dash pads, smooth and satisfying speed simulation and animations, coins and experience.

## General Features

- Dynamic Player Acceleration:
- Coins and XP
- XP leveling system: maximum speed increases monotonically based on current level
- Dash and Jump Pads
- Dynamic Centrifugal Force Response

# Camera Dynamics

- Player-Focused Camera: Camera follows player position and direction, ajusting its pitch and yaw to match that of the player. Allows for smooth gameplay with loops.
- Zoom Control: Change camera zoom via custom objects.
